This sample client is easy enough to run. 
In order for it to work, you'll need to build and deploy the sample service with a command
that looks something like 
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dmaven.tomcat.home=/usr/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.26 clean install sakai:deploy
from inside the axis2 directory. Once you have it deployed and Tomcat is up and running, then you can
run this from inside Eclipse by selecting Run/Run As/Java Application.
As is, you should see "Hello, Katie" appear on the console. That means everything is good!

You can probably run this from the command line as well, but that involves setting
the build path. You should be able to get away with pulling in just the axis2, axiom and jsr173_api jars.
